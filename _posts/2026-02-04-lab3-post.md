### Here is my lab 2 experience!
This lab was fun! I enjoyed making a new blog now that I knew how to do it. Uploading the pictures was kind of tricky but I figured it out. Adding the author tag was new to me so it stumpted me for a second, but I was able to figure it out. I still get confused editing the html file, espectially if I didn't write it. Im just bad at figuring out what each line does and what it talks to, but with more practice I should hopefully get better at that. 


#### Things learned from this experience
- [x] I got better at adding links because we had to add a link to out [Compsci Page](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340)
  - [x] I struggle with html code so I need to improve my [foundation knowledge](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/make-a-website).
    - [x] Don't get behind ever again because this is a hard class and there is too much work to procrastinate.
  - [x] How to spruce up my blog
- [X] Read every single instruction at all times. It always helps!
