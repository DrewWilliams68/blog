### Welcome to my blog!
Creating this post sure was an experience... I am really horrible at setting up software and computer files... Which is very awesome for a computer science major. I struggled a lot with the [Ruby][Ruby-picture] download. Which going to office hours with Dr. Goadrich helped a lot. I still don't understand how to the use the computer console very well, but I guess I will figure that out as we go. I still cant get my github link to work so I need to figure that out again but we will see how the rest of the class goes. 


#### Things learned from this experience
- [x] To try every consol I can think of.
  - [x] Fix my computer file system because my storage is [Awful][Awful-picture]
    - [x] Do all of my work completely early, because I struggle alot on debugging.
  - [x] Power through and take debugging more serious. I don't wanna rely on office hours all of the time
- [X] Read every single instruction at all times. I must have messed up the github stuff and my software
