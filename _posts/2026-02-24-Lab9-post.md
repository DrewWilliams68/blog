### Here is my lab 6 experience!
This lab was fun! I enjoyed making thinking about the different user stories and physically realizing them in different forms like flow charts. Learning how to use the LucidChart and making a flow diagram out of it! Using the Redgate software was also interesting, but overall I am happy with how this lab turned out. I also am enjoying making another blog because it has been a second since my last post. Thank you!


#### Things learned from this experience
- [x] I learned how to use LucidChart and make flow charts [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
  - [x] I got more familiar towards the structure and creation of user stories.
    - [x] I also learned how to better conceptualize different senarios such as this one.
  - [x] I don't fully understand what to do with the [RedGate](https://www.red-gate.com/products/redgate-data-modeler/) charts but I think I got at least the graphs correct. 
- [X] Stop waiting until the last minute, because it inhibits my ability to ask for help!
