## Tuba Is The Supreme Instrument!!!!
##### Let me give you a few reasons why tuba is the best:
- [x] It is 4 letters ( which are T, U, B, A)
    - [x] Its big
        - [x] Its loud but can also be soft
        - [x] It looks cool
    - [x] Its multi purpose (play it or use it as a weapon of choice in the apocalypse...)
- [x] Would win in a fight against the other instruments (except string bass and timpani but I don't like them so it doesn't count)

##### Anyways Its an awesome instrument that awesome people play... So if you want to be awesome play the tuba.
